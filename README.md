# LeggedRobotPyMunk
A simple legged robot created in PyMunk. This was created to test out some scenarios where the physics appeared to behave strangely.
  
# To run  
Please use Python 3.
Install the following packages:  
* `pip install pygame`
* `pip install pymunk`  
  
and then run using:  
`python3 main.py`
  
# Known issues  
The gravity and y axis are inverted in the newer versions of PyMunk. I'm sure you can figure it out and fix it.
