# LeggedRobotPyMunk
A simple legged robot created in PyMunk. This was created to test out some scenarios where the physics appeared to behave strangely. It involved making the robot move over some obstacles. As of now the obstacles are removed. To re-enable them, un-comment the `self.createTerrainRandomBoxesLowDense()` line.
